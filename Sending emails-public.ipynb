    "\n",
    "Note 2: This tutorial is about using Python and Outlook. This means that all emails will be sent from your email address, which you have specified in Outlook. It may be that some exchange server setting might prevent some actions. Shall this happen, check with your IT administrators. \n",

    "Note 3: Sending email using Python is actually pretty simple. Just use few lines from cell below. However, this wouldn’t be so useful without having some additional code that is doing the heavy lifting for you. Therefore, let me go through steps I did in my case and I invite you to consider what would be right approach in your situation."
